%\subsection*{About the Korean translation}

%In January 2015, the Acorn publishing company (\href{http://www.acornpub.co.kr}{www.acornpub.co.kr}) in South Korea did a huge amount of work in translating and publishing
%this book (as it was in August 2014) into Korean.

%It's available now at \href{http://go.yurichev.com/17343}{their website}.

%The translator is Byungho Min (\href{http://go.yurichev.com/17344}{twitter/tais9}).
%The cover art was done by the artistic Andy Nechaevsky, a friend of the author:
%\href{http://go.yurichev.com/17023}{facebook/andydinka}.
%Acorn also holds the copyright to the Korean translation.

%So, if you want to have a \IT{real} book on your shelf in Korean and
%want to support this work, it is now available for purchase.

%\subsection*{About the Persian/Farsi translation}

%In 2016 the book was translated by Mohsen Mostafa Jokar (who is also known to Iranian community for his translation of Radare manual\footnote{\url{http://rada.re/get/radare2book-persian.pdf}}).
%It is available on the publisherâ€™s website\footnote{\url{http://goo.gl/2Tzx0H}} (Pendare Pars).

%\subsection*{About the Chinese translation}

%In April 2017, translation to Chinese was completed by Chinese PTPress. They are also the Chinese translation copyright holders.

% The Chinese version is available for order here: \url{http://www.epubit.com.cn/book/details/4174}. A partial review and history behind the translation can be found here: \url{http://www.cptoday.cn/news/detail/3155}.

%% If you're using first-person (I, me) in the acknowledgments, you should change the following back to first-person, too - Ren.
%The principal translator is Archer, to whom the author owes very much. He was extremely meticulous (in a good sense) and reported most of the known mistakes and bugs, which is very important in literature such as this book.
%The author would recommend his services to any other author!

%The guys from \href{http://www.antiy.net/}{Antiy Labs} has also helped with translation. \href{http://www.epubit.com.cn/book/onlinechapter/51413}{Here is preface} written by them.
