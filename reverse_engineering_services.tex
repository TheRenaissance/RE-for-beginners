I have tried many jobs in my life, but, surprisingly (even to myself),
the job I'm the most proud of is rewriting large piece(s) of compiled code back to C/C++.
This is an extremely boring and slow process. I once spent more than a year on rewriting 100KB DLL to pure C,
and it was like a full-time job.

And expensive.

% I think I got the intent right (original: By the way, a lot of tricks has been added to this book during this work.)
A lot of tricks have been added to this book as a result of this work.

I assume such a service could be interesting to those who inherited some compiled code with no source code.
