I have an idea to replace all the OllyDbg examples in the book with examples using some other debugger.
I have nothing against OllyDbg, but it has a GUI and uses small fonts, and the screenshots are somewhat unsuitable for the book.
Maybe I could use GDB, rada.re, WinDbg, or maybe some other console debugger?

What do you think about it?
Should I leave OllyDbg examples, or would GDB examples would be OK?
